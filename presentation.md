# Thanks!

Thanks for coming, thanks to the conference organisers, thanks to those who have advised me and, in advance, to the panel!

# Not Legal Advice

I'm not a legal professional and I can't advise on the law.

# Panel Introductions

# Copyright

::: incremental

> The right by law to be the entity which determines who may publish, copy and distribute a piece of writing, music, picture or other work of authorship.

[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copyright](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/copyright)

- [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) of 1886: Copyright is immediately bestowed upon a work the moment it is created, without requiring any registration.

# Who owns the copyright on my code?

If you're a researcher, probably **not** you!:

::: incremental

- Staff - usually the university ([UK law](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/11), [US law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/201)).
- Research students - usually the university (e.g. University of Sheffield [student IP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/research-services/commercialisation/student-ip)).
- Different rules for undergrads.
- Funded research can have specific agreements in place - check with your PI, or your funding agreements.

# License

::: incremental

- Gives right to use copyright material in specific ways, without changing ownership.
- No license : no **right** to copy (or to use).

# Questions for panel...

# Should RSEs advise a default open source licence? Which would it be?

# Should the organisations we work for or study at grant us ownership of the code we produce to licence as we chose?

# How can we make good decisions on whether code should remain closed source for commercial reasons?

# Is it a good idea for research funders to advise or stipulate a particular licence?

# How do we ensure copyright and licensing are correctly managed for projects where people from multiple organisations contribute code?

# How much does the issue of licensing cause useful code to languish on researchers and RSEs laptops, compared with other barriers?

# Thanks

Thanks again to everyone involved!
