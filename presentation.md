# Copyright

::: incremental

- Copyright is a type of intellectual property, particularly relevant to software.
- [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) of 1886: Copyright is immediately bestowed upon a work the moment it is created, without requiring any registration.

# Who owns the copyright on my code?

If you're UK researcher, probably **not** you! e.g. University of Sheffield:

- Staff or research students - usually the university ([student IP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/research-services/commercialisation/student-ip), [UK gov](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/11).)
- Different rules for undergrads.
- Funded research can have specific agreements in place - check with your PI, or your funding agreements.

# License

::: incremental

- Gives right to use copyright material in specific ways, without changing ownership.
- No license : no **right** to copy.

# Questions for panel...

# Should RSEs advise a default open source licence? Which would it be?

# Should the organisations we work for or study at grant us ownership of the code we produce to licence as we chose?

# How can we make good decisions on whether code should remain closed source for commercial reasons?

# Is it a good idea for research funders to advise or stipluate a particular licence?

# How do we ensure copyright and licensing are correctly managed for projects where people from multiple organisations contribute code?

# How do we avoid useful code languishing on researchers and RSEs laptops when it could be doing something useful for the world via a licence?
